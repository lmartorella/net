// Trying to poll register 1
[01][03][00][01][00][02][95][CB]

// Is giving
// Analyzed with a scope, since missing trailing sync
start = 0
stop = 1

start 1000000 stop  0x01
start 0001001 stop  0x90   -> Strange, it seems to respond to 0x10
start 0100000 stop  0x02   -> Illegal Data Address, if error would be 0x83...
start 0000000 stop  0x00   -> missing CRC!
start 0000000 stop  0x00


Definitively, not MODBUS



Instead reading 0x400
[01][03][04][00][00][02][C5][3B]

Gives result!!!
<01><03><04><00><03><FF><C0><4B><93>
[1025]:         3
[1026]:         65472 (-64)

However, often it has a lot of <zero> on front, due to missing sync
<00> <00>... we need to get rid of these
