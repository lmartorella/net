# Web application

This is a sample web application that leverages the [JS web-server](../../src/web/README.md) to interact with the Home system remotely.

It is written in AngularjS (quite obsolete now) and supports:
- see solar panel real-time statistics and charts, up to 4 days in the past
- check and program the garden programmer.
- start/stop the server
- access the logs.
